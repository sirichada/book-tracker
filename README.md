**ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

- the goal of this project was to create a way for me to visualize what i've read in a year. previously, i have used goodreads and i found the UI to be outdated. lastly, i was inspired by storygraph on how there have also been discussions on how the star rating system should be reworked to be more specific, which was praised on storygraph over goodreads.
- for these reasons, i made my own booktracker: a combination betwen goodreads and storygraph, which allowed me to both review and visualize what i've read over the past year into a digital library.
